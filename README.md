# Next-day Rain Prediction

Files in the repository:

- `src/analysis.ipynb`: Main file that follows a logical order of the pre-processing techniques and models outlined in the report.

- `src/utils.py`: It contains user-defined functions that are used intensively in `analysis.ipynb`. Every function is thoroughly commented.

- `src/data/placeholder.txt`: This file should be replaced with the actual weather data.
